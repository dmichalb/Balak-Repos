            <p>Streetcar Subs of Desire was the brain child of a Mrs. Smith and her young son. In the age of repurposing old vans and setting out into the food truck industry, Mrs. Smith and her son stumbled upon an idea: mobile restaurants,semi-similar to food trucks--in a streetcar. The idea came to Mrs. Smith when she decided she was going to try and have lunch with her son at school. She didn't get to do this often with her lunch break being short and the logistics of having to drive to pick up food, drive to her son's school, eat, and then drive back to work. As she was rushing to her son's school, she noticed a streetcar passing by and thought to herself, "If streetcars sold food, I would save myself a ton of time!"</p>
            <p>Streetcar Subs of Desire is a functioning streetcar with a route and licensed streetcar operator, but it also has a fully functional, mini sub-shop and sells sandwiches to passengers. The shop allows for people who rush around on errands or visit their children during their lunch break the opportunity to grab a healthy lunch on the go. There are a variety of sandwiches to choose from, including the restaurant's most popular picks: "The Manly Stanley," "Simple Stella," and "Build your Own Blanche."</p>
