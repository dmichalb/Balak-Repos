             <p>I grew up in <strong>Texas</strong> but moved to <strong>Arkansas</strong> to attend the <span style="background-color: lavender; boarder: thin solid purple;">University of Central Arkansas, where I received a full-ride scholarship.</span> I married my best friend since high school during my second year in college. He served in the Air Force and, just before my last semester of college, was moved to a base in <strong>Florida</strong>. I returned to school in Arkansas for 6 months, graduated early, and then returned to Florida where we lived for one year.</p>
             <p>We moved back to Texas in 2018 and now own a home in Gainesville. He is currently halfway finished with his degree to become a pilot and I am in my second year of teaching middle school English.</p>

             <h2><em>Past Experiences</em></h2>
               <img src="images/classroom.jpg" alt="College Classroom" />
             <p>From January 2017 to December 2017, I worked at the <strong>Faulkner County Juvenile Court</strong> in Conway, Arkansas. I was a Risk Assessment Intern, meaning my job was to analyze their newly implemented risk assessment tool and determine its effectiveness in reducing juvenile recidivism rates.</p>
             <p>During my time with FCJC, I was able to obtain research that accurately proved that the SAVRY risk assessment tool, when effectively implemented, was able to reduce the number of repeat juvenile offenders.</p>

             <h2><em>Hobbies</em></h2>
               <img src="images/code.jpg" alt="Image of code" />
             <p>In my down time I enjoy many things. Read, writing, and playing games are among my favorite past times. However, I also enjoy brainteasers and puzzles like sudoku and word searches.</p>
             <p>My interest in coding and programming was sparked during my search to find something that would be both exciting and challenging. I began practicing code through codecadamy and have been hooked ever since.</p>
