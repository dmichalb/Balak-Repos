        <h2><em>About Me</em></h2>
        <p>I grew up in Texas but moved to Arkansas to attend the University of Central Arkansas, where I received a full-ride scholarship. I married my best friend since high school during my second year in college. He served in the Air Force and, just before my last semester of college, was moved to a base in Florida. I returned to school in Arkansas for 6 months, graduated early, and then returned to Florida where we lived for one year.</p>
        <p>We moved back to Texas in 2018 and now own a home in Gainesville. He is currently halfway finished with his degree to become a pilot and I am in my second year of teaching middle school English.</p>
        
        <h2><em>Past Experiences</em></h2>
        <p>From January 2017 to December 2017, I worked at the Faulkner County Juvenile Court in Conway, Arkansas. I was a Risk Assessment Intern, meaning my job was to analyze their newly implemented risk assessment tool and determine its effectiveness in reducing juvenile recidivism rates.</p>
        <p>During my time with FCJC, I was able to obtain research that accurately proved that the SAVRY risk assessment tool, when effectively implemented, was able to reduce the number of repeat juvenile offenders.</p>
       
        <h2><em>Hobbies</em></h2>
        <p>In my down time I enjoy many things. Read, writing, and playing games are among my favorite past times. However, I also enjoy brainteasers and puzzles like sudoku and word searches.</p>
        <p>My interest in coding and programming was sparked during my search to find something that would be both exciting and challenging. I began practicing code through codecadamy and have been hooked ever since.</p>
